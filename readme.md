**ForbocAI** is an advanced AI research and gaming startup building the substrates for the next generation of generative narrative gaming. We bridge the gap between retro aesthetics and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through sophisticated neuro-symbolic architectures.

## 🏗 The Forboc Engine

Our core technology is a **Neuro-Symbolic Game Engine** that combines the reliability of deterministic systems with the creative fluidity of Generative AI. 

### Key Pillars:

1.  **The Substrate (ECS-Redux Hybrid)**
    *   A strictly functional Entity-Component-System (ECS) backbone.
    *   Decoupled state management ensuring 100% determinism and replayability.
    *   Optimized for high-concurrency agent simulations.

2.  **Generative NPC Cortex**
    *   **Local-First Inference**: Running fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) like SmolLM2 directly in the browser via WebGPU.
    *   **RAG Memory Architecture**: "Micro-NPCs" with persistent long-term memory buffers using local vector stores (Orama/Voy).
    *   **Zero-Latency**: Eliminating cloud dependency for privacy and performance.

3.  **Ghost Agent QA**
    *   Autonomous auditing pipelines.
    *   "Ghost Agents" playtest the game procedurally, ensuring valid states and balanced difficulty curves before humans ever touch the build.

4.  **The Agent Economy (Decentralized Protocol)**
    *   A Web3 native layer for agent interoperability powered by **$FAI**.
    *   **Tokenized Souls**: Users can own their NPC's logic weights and memory states, trading and transporting them across compatible multiverse environments.

*   **Q2 2026**: Neuro-Symbolic Bridge (LLM-to-ECS Action Translation)
*   **Q3 2026**: Agent Economy Beta (Wallet Connect & IPFS Export)
