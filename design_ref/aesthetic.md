## Atmosphere and Texture
The world manifests as a decayed, somber reality where the boundaries between the industrial and the biological have dissolved. It is an environment of intense material tactility, defined not by sleek futurism but by a "used universe" feel pushed to an organic extreme.
Surfaces are rarely smooth or pristine; they are pitted, stained, and worn, suggesting a history of fluids and friction. There is a pervasive dampness, a sense of humid, stagnant air clinging to every object.

## Biopunk Technology
The defining aesthetic is the convergence of machinery and anatomy. Technology does not look manufactured; it looks grown, harvested, or fossilized.
- **Forms:** Devices mimic the internal architecture of the body. Designs feature spinal ridges, rib-like cages, and pelvic curves. Symmetries are biological rather than geometric—imperfect, lumpen, and nodular.
- **Materials:** Instead of metal and glass, objects appear constructed from resin that resembles hardened gristle, bone, or chitin. Controls are gelatinous, yielding to the touch like flesh. Cables trail like intestines or umbilical cords, thick and pulsating.
- **Interface:** Interaction is physical and intimate. Buttons are nipple-like protrusions; screens are deeply set into thick, fleshy bezels, displaying grainy, analog data that looks like ultrasound or endoscopy feeds.

## Architecture and Environment
Spaces feel cavernous, stripped-down, and repurpcased.
- **Interiors:** Walls are textured with peeling layers, exposing rough concrete or water-damaged plaster. Rooms are sparsely furnished, emphasizing the singular, sculptural presence of the bio-machines within them.
- **Lighting:** Illumination is practical and shadowy, carving out volumes of darkness. Light sources often feel trapped within heavy fixtures, casting long, stark shadows that accentuate the texture of the organic machines.
- **Theatricality:** The setting often resembles a stage or an art installation. Key locations—autopsy theaters, performance spaces—have a ritualistic emptiness, focusing all attention on the central act of bodily transformation.

## Design Language
The overall design language is one of "evolutionary improvisation." Objects look like they have adapted to survive in a harsh, chemically altered environment. There is a distinct lack of sharp angles; everything is rounded, slumped, or fluid, as if the force of gravity is heavily weighing down on soft matter. The aesthetic celebrates the visceral—scars, sutures, and orifices are not hidden but framed as central functional and aesthetic elements.
