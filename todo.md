# ForbocAI Startup Execution Checklist

This document tracks the execution of the ForbocAI startup launch, focusing on professional presence, investor readiness, and the decentralized "Agent Economy" protocol.

## Phase 1: Digital Presence & Branding (Immediate)

## Phase 2: Investor Readiness (Seed Round Prep)

    - [ ] **Solution**: "The Forboc Engine: Neuro-symbolic, deterministic, and owned."
    - [ ] **Tech Moat**: ECS-Redux purity + Local SLM optimization + Ghost Agent testing.
    - [ ] **Roadmap**: Game release -> Engine licensing -> Agent Economy Protocol.
    - [ ] **Ask**: Seed round amount (e.g., $500k - $2M) for team expansion.

## Phase 3: The Agent Economy (Protocol Layer)
- [ ] **Technical Whitepaper ("Litepaper")**
    - [ ] Define the **"Agent Interoperability Standard" (AIS)**.
    - [ ] Explain how an NPC's *Memory State* (vector embeddings) and *Logic Config* (Behavior Tree weights) can be stored on-chain (or IPFS).
    - [ ] Define the value prop: "Train an agent in Forboc; sell it to a player in another world."
- [ ] **Tokenomics Draft**
    - [ ] Utility token ($AGNT?) for compute credits (cloud inference) or protocol upgrades.
    - [ ] Governance layer for the Agent Standard.

## Phase 4: Product & Traction
- [ ] **Technical Demo Video**
    - [ ] Record a 60-second clip of the "Ghost Agent" playing the game automatically.
    - [ ] Overlay technical metrics (latency, decision confidence).
    - [ ] Embed this video on the landing page hero section.
- [ ] **Waitlist Collection**
    - [ ] Add a simple email capture form (e.g., Typeform or Mailchimp) to the "Request Pitch Deck" button.
