Here's where we are:

Built & Deployed:

API (Haskell Servant): Live with core endpoints — agents, memory, bridge validation, soul export/import
The 'Mind' (API): I’ve architected the cloud layer as a stateless Haskell service. It handles the 'Pure Logic' (decisions/rules) without holding state, while we offload the generative parts (LLM/Memory) to the local SDK.

SDK (forbocai on npm): TypeScript client with Cortex interface, Agent state machine, and CLI.
Right now, I'm building that SDK to bridge the two—basically creating a 'Neuro-Symbolic Grid' where the API acts as the laws for the AI's thoughts.
