A lot—we're into the architecture phase.

Here's where we are:

Built & Deployed:

API (Haskell Servant): Live with core endpoints — agents, memory, bridge validation, soul export/import
The 'Mind' (API): I’ve architected the cloud layer as a stateless Haskell service. It handles the 'Pure Logic' (decisions/rules) without holding state, while we offload the generative parts (LLM/Memory) to the local SDK.

SDK (forbocai on npm): TypeScript client with Cortex interface, Agent state machine, and CLI.
Right now, I'm building that SDK to bridge the two—basically creating a 'Neuro-Symbolic Grid' where the API acts as the laws for the AI's thoughts.

Docs: Full OpenAPI spec via Fern (https://forbocai.docs.buildwithfern.com/) + marketing site live (https://forbocai.github.io)

In Progress:

🔄 Integrating SDK ↔ Game Mechanics (the "Neuro-Symbolic Bridge" — where LLM directives get mapped to game actions)
🔄 Local SLM inference (currently targeting WebLLM/ONNX)
🔄 RAG memory pipeline for persistent NPC recall
The core architecture is solid — I'm looking for a cofounder to help accelerate the AI integration layer specifically. Want to hop on a call this week? I can walk you through the codebase.
