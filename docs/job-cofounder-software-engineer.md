## About ForbocAI
ForbocAI is building the substrate for **Autonomous Worlds**. We are bridging the gap between rigid traditional Game AI and chaotic Generative AI by deploying local-first Neuro-Symbolic AI engines.

### Our Technology
- **Redux-Based Entity System**: Data-driven, functional programming architecture with pure reducers and memoized selectors for deterministic game state management
- **Behavior Tree AI**: Hierarchical bot system implementing Safety → Mission → Combat → Default behavior nodes with utility-based action scoring
- **Procedural Level Generation**: Multiple algorithms with quality assurance validation pipelines

### Our Technology Vision
- **The Cortex**: Local-first generative AI—hardware-accelerated SLM inference running entirely on-device for privacy-preserving NPC intelligence
- **Edge-Resident Memory**: RAG pipelines with native vector search, enabling NPCs that remember, learn, and evolve through player interactions
- **Neuro-Symbolic Bridge**: Hybrid architecture where LLMs set high-level goals while deterministic behavior trees handle real-time micro-actions
- **Decentralized Agent Economy**: Tokenized NPC "souls" (memories, stats, trained logic) as portable, player-owned digital assets via IPFS and smart contracts

### What We're Building
| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **LLM Integration** | Local SLM inference, prompt engineering, structured output enforcement |
| **Memory Pipeline** | Vector embeddings, IndexedDB persistence, context retrieval for dynamic NPC dialogue |
| **Action Grammar** | JSON schema for AI-to-ECS translation—thoughts, dialogue, and physical actions |
| **Ghost Agent QA** | Autonomous play-testing bots that explore, stress-test, and generate balancing metrics |
| **Web3 Layer** | Wallet auth, IPFS soul export, ERC-7007/6551 agent contracts |

## What We're Looking For
We are seeking a **founding engineer** to help build the next generation of autonomous gaming AI. As a cofounder, you will have significant ownership and influence over the technical direction of the company.

### Ideal Candidate
- **AI/ML Systems**: Experience with LLM inference, embeddings, RAG architectures, or agent-based systems
- **Runtime Performance**: Workers, optimization, high-performance web/native tech
- **Game AI**: Behavior trees, GOAP, utility AI, pathfinding, or ECS-based game engines
- **Web3 (Bonus)**: Solidity, IPFS, token standards (ERC-721/6551/7007), wallet integration
- **Entrepreneurial Mindset**: Desire for significant equity ownership and influence over product direction
- **TypeScript Expertise**: Strong functional programming skills with React hooks, Redux Toolkit, and immutable state patterns
- **Game Development**: Experience with game loops, Entity-Component-Systems, or physics simulations
- **AI/Automation**: Familiarity with behavior trees, utility AI, pathfinding (A*), or agent-based systems
