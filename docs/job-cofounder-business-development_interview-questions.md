## 1. The Capital Raise (Priority #1)
*This is the most critical immediate function. We need someone who can secure the bag.*

**Q: "Walk me through how you would pitch ForbocAI to a traditional SaaS VC versus a Web3-native fund. What parts of our narrative would you emphasize for each?"**
*   *Look for:* Ability to toggle between "Enterprise AI Infrastructure" (SaaS VC) and "Decentralized Autonomous Agents/Protocol" (Web3 VC). They should know that SaaS VCs hate "tokens" and Web3 VCs hate "low upside recurring revenue."

**Q: "We are pre-revenue and pre-product traction. Investors will say we are 'too early.' How do you counter that objection in a seed round meeting?"**
*   *Look for:* Confidence in selling the *vision* and *team*. Answers should involve leveraging the "Neuro-Symbolic" moat, the "Privacy-First/Local" trend (market timing), or creating FOMO around the Agent Economy.

**Q: "Who are the first 5 investors (angels or funds) you would contact for Forboc, and why?"**
*   *Look for:* Specificity. Do they actually have a network? If they name-drop generic Tier 1s (Sequoia, a16z) without a warm intro strategy, they are likely unqualified. We want names like "Generalist Capital," gaming-specific angels, or AI infrastructure funds.

## 2. Product & Technology Grasp
*They don't need to code, but they must sell deep tech.*

**Q: "Explain our 'Neuro-Symbolic Bridge' to me as if I were a Studio Head who thinks Generative AI is just 'unpredictable chatbots'."**
*   *Look for:* The ability to articulate *Reliability*. They must explain that the LLM provides the *intent* ("I want to attack"), but the deterministic rule engine executes the *mechanic* (checking HP, ammo, range). Key phrase: "Solving Hallucination through Architecture."

**Q: "Why does Forboc focus on 'Local Inference' (Cortex) instead of just using OpenAI's API? What is the business value of that technical decision?"**
*   *Look for:* Understanding of Unit Economics. API calls = marginal cost per second. Local Inference = Zero marginal cost. This is the only way to scale persistent, always-on NPCs without going bankrupt.

## 3. Go-to-Market & Ecosystem Strategy
*We are a platform. We die without developers.*

**Q: "Our roadmap starts with 'Mid-tier Studios' rather than AAA or Indies. Do you agree with this targeting? If so, how do you get a meeting with them? If not, who should we target?"**
*   *Look for:* Strategic thinking. AAAs are too slow/risk-averse. Indies might not have the budget/technical skill. Mid-tier is likely the sweet spot (need differentiation to survive), but it's hard to break in. Do they have a plan?

**Q: "We have a chicken-and-egg problem: Players won't value 'Portable Souls' until multiple games support them. Developers won't support them until players demand it. How do you break this loop?"**
*   *Look for:* "Reference Implementation" or "First-Party Content." They should realize we likely need to build (or heavily partner to build) the first "Killer App" (like *Goetéian Chthonica*) to prove value.

## 4. Operational & "Skin in the Game"
*This is an equity-only role initially. We need true believers.*

**Q: "This is an equity-only position until we raise our seed round. What is your personal runway, and how do you define 'success' for the next 6 months?"**
*   *Look for:* Honesty and financial reality. If they need a salary in 1 month, they aren't a fit. "Success" should be defined as "Closing the Round" or "Signed Partnerships," not "Brand Awareness."

**Q: "Describe a time you had to fire a client or walk away from a deal because it didn't align with the long-term vision."**
*   *Look for:* Integrity and strategic discipline. We don't want to sell consulting hours just to survive if it kills the product focus.

## 5. Practical Exercise (Optional but Recommended)
**Task:** "Here is our current Pitch Deck slide on 'The Problem' (Game AI is dumb vs GenAI is chaotic). Spend 5 minutes and tell me how you would rewrite the headline or voice-over to make it more urgent for an investor."
*   *Look for:* Punchiness. "Static vs Chaotic" is good, but can they make it *visceral*? (e.g., "The Industry is Dying of Boredom")
