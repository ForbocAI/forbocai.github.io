## About ForbocAI
ForbocAI is building the substrate for **Autonomous Worlds**. We are bridging the gap between rigid traditional Game AI and chaotic Generative AI by deploying local-first Neuro-Symbolic AI engines.

### Our Vision
- **The Cortex**: Local-first generative AI—hardware-accelerated SLM inference running entirely on-device for privacy-preserving NPC intelligence
- **Edge-Resident Memory**: RAG pipelines with native vector search, enabling NPCs that remember, learn, and evolve through player interactions
- **Neuro-Symbolic Bridge**: Hybrid architecture where LLMs set high-level goals while deterministic behavior trees handle real-time micro-actions
- **Decentralized Agent Economy**: Tokenized NPC "souls" (memories, stats, trained logic) as portable, player-owned digital assets via IPFS and smart contracts

### Market Opportunity
| Segment | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gaming AI** | $5.5B market growing 25%+ annually—ripe for disruption by edge AI |
| **AI Gaming Agents** | Emerging category where players delegate or collaborate with intelligent NPCs |
| **Web3 Gaming** | $65B+ market seeking genuine utility beyond speculation |
| **Native AI** | Untapped opportunity for privacy-first, zero-install AI experiences |
