## 1. Company Page Setup
**Name**: ForbocAI
**Tagline**: Autonomous Worlds. Architected Agents.
**Website**: https://forbocai.github.io
**Industry**: Software Development, Computer Games, Artificial Intelligence
**Company Size**: 2-10 employees
**Type**: Privately Held

**About**:
ForbocAI is bridging the gap between retro aesthetics and Artificial General Intelligence. We are building the substrate for the next generation of generative narrative gaming—where NPCs are not just scripts, but persistent, owning-operating autonomous agents.

Our core technology, the **Forboc Engine**, combines the reliability of deterministic ECS (Entity-Component-System) game loops with the fluid intelligence of local-first Small Language Models (SLMs). This "Neuro-symbolic" approach allows for characters that can converse naturally, remember long-term interactions via RAG pipelines, and make strategic decisions without breaking game logic.

We are also architecting the **Agent Interoperability Standard (AIS)**, a decentralized protocol allowing Agent Logic and Memory States to be owned, traded, and transported across compatible virtual worlds.

## 2. Founder Profile Update (Sean Dinwiddie)

**Headline**:
Founder & CTO at ForbocAI | Building Neuro-Symbolic Game Engines | Decentralized AI Architecture

**Experience Entry**:
**Role**: Founder & Chief Technology Officer
**Company**: ForbocAI
**Dates**: Jan 2026 – Present
**Location**: Remote
**Description**:
Leading the development of the Forboc Engine, a local-first Generative AI gaming platform.
*   **Architected** a high-performance Entity-Component-System (ECS) in TypeScript/WebGPU to support thousands of concurrent autonomous agents.
*   **Developed** the "Micro-NPC" cortex: a pipeline running quantized SLMs (Small Language Models) locally in the browser for privacy-focused, zero-latency character interactions.
*   **Designed** the "Ghost Agent" automated testing suite, utilizing reinforcement learning techniques to audit procedural content generation.
*   **Building** the Agent Economy Protocol for decentralized ownership of NPC behavioral weights and memory vectors.

## 3. "Hello World" Post Draft
*(For use on both Personal and Company pages)*

**Text**:
We’ve been quiet, but we’ve been building.

Today, I’m excited to unveil **ForbocAI**.

The problem with current Game AI is that it's static—decision trees that always lead to the same place.
The problem with extensive GenAI integration is that it's chaotic—hallucinations that break game immersion and mechanics.

We are building the bridge: **Neuro-Symbolic Agents**.

At ForbocAI, we use deterministic systems (ECS) to handle the rules of physics and combat, while layering local-first Small Language Models (SLMs) to handle high-level reasoning, dialogue, and memory.

This isn't just a chatbot in a game. It's an agent that:
1.  **Observes** the world (via vector embedding streams).
2.  **Reasons** about its goals (using a local RAG buffer).
3.  **Acts** deterministically (executing verified game commands).

And soon, you will **own** them. We are working on a decentralized framing that lets you train an NPC and take its "Soul" (logic + memory) to other worlds.

We are opening our Seed Round for strategic partners who see the future of Autonomous Worlds.
