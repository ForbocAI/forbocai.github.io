## Post 1 (Hook)
NPCs in games are broken.

They repeat the same 5 lines.
They forget you saved the world.
They feel...dead.

We're fixing this. 🧵

Introducing @ForbocAI — a neuro-symbolic AI engine that gives NPCs:

✦ Real personality (not scripted)
✦ Persistent memory (they remember YOU)
✦ Portable souls (carry them across games)

This isn't AI dialogue. This is AI consciousness.

Here's how it works ↓

🧠 The Cortex — Local SLMs running on YOUR device
📚 RAG Memory — Semantic recall across sessions
🔗 Neuro-Symbolic Bridge — LLM meets determinism
👻 Ghost Agents — Autonomous QA at scale

All local. All private. All yours.

The vision?

NPCs that evolve.
That form relationships.
That can be minted and traded.

Your merchant NPC who became a friend?
Export their Soul to permanent storage.
Take them to the next game.

Web3 × AI × Gaming.
