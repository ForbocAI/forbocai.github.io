🚀 **Excited to announce what we've been building at ForbocAI.**

The gaming industry generates $200B+ annually, yet NPCs—the characters that bring worlds to life—remain static, scripted, and forgettable.

We're changing that with a Neuro-Symbolic AI Engine:

▸ **Local-first SLM inference** (privacy by default)
▸ **RAG-powered persistent memory**
▸ **Deterministic action validation**
▸ **Portable "Souls" via IPFS/Web3**

Our SDK documentation is now live: [forbocai.docs.buildwithfern.com](https://forbocai.docs.buildwithfern.com)

For game developers, this means autonomous NPCs that remember, reason, and evolve—without cloud dependencies or per-token costs.

The future of interactive storytelling is here.
