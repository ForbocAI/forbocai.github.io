# Wellfound (AngelList) Profile Strategy

## 1. Company Information
**Company Name**: ForbocAI
**One-Line Pitch**: Local-first Neuro-Symbolic AI engines for the next generation of autonomous gaming.
**Website**: https://forbocai.github.io
**Location**: San Francisco Bay Area (Remote)
**Markets**: Artificial Intelligence, Gaming, Web3, Generative AI, Developer Tools

## 2. Company Highlights (The "Why Us")
*   **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**: We are solving the "hallucination problem" in games by merging deterministic ECS game loops with fluid SLM (Small Language Model) intelligence.
*   **Privacy-First AI**: Our "Micro-NPC" cortex runs entirely on-device using WebGPU, eliminating cloud costs and latency while preserving user privacy.
*   **Decentralized Ownership**: We are building the protocol for the "Agent Economy," enabling portable, tokenized ownership of trained NPC logic and memory states.

## 3. Product Description
ForbocAI is building the substrate for **Autonomous Worlds**. 

Traditional Game AI is rigid—finite state machines and behavior trees that become repetitive. Modern Generative AI is chaotic—LLMs that break game rules and immersion. ForbocAI bridges this gap.

Our engine allows developers to deploy "Micro-NPCs": characters powered by local fine-tuned models that can reason, remember (via RAG), and act, while strictly adhering to the deterministic rules of the game world. We provide the tools (Ghost Agent QA, Neuro-ECS Bridge) to make this robust and shippable.

We are currently in the **Pre-Seed / Seed** stage, finalizing our core engine and preparing for our first major tech demo launch.

## 4. Culture & Values
*   **Aesthetic Excellence**: We believe tools should be beautiful. We bridge retro-futurism with modern UX.
*   **Technical Rigor**: We don't just wrap APIs. We build custom engines, write standard-compliant Typescript, and value performance.
*   **Agentic Future**: We are building for a future where software is alive, autonomous, and owned by the user.

## 5. Founder Bio (Sean Dinwiddie)
**Role**: Founder / CTO
**Bio**:
Sean is a Full Stack Architect and AI Systems Engineer with deep expertise in functional programming and reactive architectures. Before founding ForbocAI, he specialized in building scalable autonomous agent systems and fine-tuning SLMs for specific domain applications. He is now focused on bringing that cognitive architecture to the gaming industry.

## 6. Hiring Status
*   **Status**: Not currently hiring (or "Hiring for Founding Engineers" if applicable).
*   **Looking For**: (Future) Rust Systems Engineers, WebGPU Specialists, Solidity Developers.
